                    <p>
                        In my Procedural Programming class, I took on the exciting challenge of creating a user-friendly calculator application using C. This project aimed to implement fundamental arithmetic operations, memory functions, and robust error handling to ensure a seamless user experience.

                    <h2>Meditation Cube Firmware</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Meditation Cube Firmware project, led by me, aimed to create the firmware for a meditation aid device known as the "Meditation Cube." This innovative project involved the use of various hardware components and programming techniques to create a unique and interactive meditation experience.

                        Key highlights of the Meditation Cube Firmware project include:
                        - **Encoder Control**: We implemented precise encoder control to allow users to adjust meditation settings easily. The firmware ensures a smooth and responsive user interface.

                        - **LED Visualization**: The Meditation Cube features LED lights that synchronize with the user's breathing rhythm, creating a calming visual experience. The firmware controls the LED patterns to enhance meditation sessions.

                        - **Breathing States**: The firmware manages different meditation states, including inhale, exhale, and hold. It provides accurate timing and transitions to guide users through their meditation practice.

                        Throughout the development process, the project received positive feedback from the team and contributed to the creation of a functional and user-friendly Meditation Cube. This project showcased my expertise in firmware development and my ability to work on innovative hardware projects.

                    <p class="feedback">
                        Throughout the development process, the project received positive feedback from both the team members and stakeholders. The firmware's precise control over the Meditation Cube's features, including the LED visualization and breathing states, was particularly well-received. This project not only enhanced my firmware development skills but also demonstrated my ability to work on hardware projects.
