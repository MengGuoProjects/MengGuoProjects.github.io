                    <h2>Meditation Cube Firmware</h2>
    
            <p>In this project, we aimed to create firmware for the 'Meditation Cube' because after COVID, I found myself easily distracted and discovered meditation really helped. So we created something to help others too. Using the Arduino platform, we crafted a simple yet effective tool for calming the mind.<br> <br>
            Key highlights of this project include:
            <ul>
                The firmware ensures a responsive user interface.</li>
                <li><b>LED Visualization:</b> The Meditation Cube features LED lights synchronized with the user's breathing rhythm, creating a visually soothing experience. The firmware controls these LED patterns to enhance meditation sessions.</li>
                <li><b>Breathing States:</b> The firmware manages different bmeditation states, including inhale, exhale, and hold. It provides accurate timing and transitions to guide users through their meditation practice.</li>
                <li><b>Encoder Control:</b> We implemented tactile control using an encoder to allow users to easily adjust meditation settings. </li>
                <li><b>Timer controlled:</b> For precise reading of the encoder and fast feedback we implemented a timer-based control that checks a preset deadline instead of using delays.</li>
            </ul>
        
            Throughout this project, I gained hands-on experience in firmware development and improved my skills in using git for collaborative work. Overall, it exemplifies our commitment: to making lives better through technology by offering moments of peace.<br> <br>

            <h2>Student Project: Elevator Control System</h2>
            <p>During my Software Engineering class, I collaborated in a team of three to design and implement an elevator control system using Petri net modeling. <br> <br> 
            Our project involved the following key aspects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Conducting research on different elevator algorithms to optimize performance.</li>
                <li>Implementing a sophisticated scheduling algorithm based on factors like priority and destination to efficiently manage elevator operations.</li>
                <li>Thoroughly testing the system using various test cases to ensure its correct functioning and reliability.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This project was a valuable experience in software engineering, teamwork, and problem-solving, and it provided insights into the world of software development.<br> <br>

        <h2>Student Project: Calculator Application</h2>
            <p>
                In my Procedural Programming class, I developed a practical calculator application in C. The project aimed to provide users with essential arithmetic functions, memory capabilities, and robust error handling.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through this project, I gained insights into software development, including C programming and error management.<br> <br>

    <h2>Java Project: To-Do List Manager</h2>
            <p>
        
            This project implements a basic to-do list manager with command-line interaction. 
            Key features of this project include:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Task Management:</b> Users can add, list, mark as completed, and remove tasks from their to-do list.</li>
                <li><b>User Interaction:</b> The project demonstrates user input handling, making it interactive and easy to use.</li>
                <li><b>Practicality:</b> It's a practical application for managing tasks and staying organized.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
            This project is an good showcase of my Java programming skills, especially in the context of user interaction and input handling. It serves as a useful tool for managing tasks and demonstrates the ability to create software solutions.<br> <br>
